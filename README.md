#Automatic Data Collection and Processing

This folder contains files that are used to actuate the electrostatic actuator in electrolytes, to collect pictures, and to process these pictures. It also contains files that fit the data to different models of the actuator. It is currently a work in progress, and a full readme will be created after the files have been organized.
